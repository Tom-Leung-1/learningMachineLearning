number of samples: 10000
number of features: 784
I see figures of single digit, ranged from 0 to 9.
The reason behind this is that centroids are the points where the distances between them and the cluster data points are minimized and 
converged. Therefore, those centroids will have features value similar to a cluster of data points. Since different cluster of data points
might have different average values, we see different figures of single digit accordingly. And It also implies the informatiion of the data,
which is about digits image.
